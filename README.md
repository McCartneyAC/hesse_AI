Can AI build a pretty good website? 

![An AI generated portrait of Herman Hesse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/McCartneyAC/hesse_AI/main/hesse.png)


All the content was written by chatGPT
all of the images generated by Dalle2 (with prompts generated mostly by chatGPT, with the exception of the image above)
All of the code written by chatGPT, with minor tweaks and bug fixes by me. The color selection for the h1 text was done partially by me, selecting two colors from the main Dalle2 image and asking GPT to build a color scheme around four colors provided.
